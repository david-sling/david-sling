A skill I am very proud of is "Learning". I am a youtube-taught full stack developer who is on his way to becoming a blockchain developer.

## Why I learnt development?

I am an Electronics and communications engineer. So why do I know ReactJS? I used to make designs for events at my university. I did like making posters, but I wanted to try out designs that are more interactive a.k.a web design. I tried it out. I designed myself a portfolio. Now I have to create the website I designed. I took a look at CSS. Honestly, it scared me. So I tried wix and GoDaddy site builder. I just couldn’t find a tool that would help me build the animations that I wanted. So I said to myself, “I really need a website, and it has to look like what I designed. So I will learn HTML and CSS basics. But that’s it. I’m never looking at code ever after that”. Well, it turns out, I can’t handle click or scroll events without javascript. So I said to myself again, “I’m learning event handlers in javascript and that’s it”. The list continued to expand. I learnt DOM manipulation. Figured it has too much boilerplate, built a function to make DOM manipulation easy. Then I found out someone already made a lot of such functions and named it React js. So yeah, I said to myself, “I’m learning Frontend development and that’s it”. But I did end up learning backend. In summary, my problem is, I learn only the things I need. My strength is, I can learn whatever I need. Ever since I realised this, I have started working on my problem of assuming I don’t have to know certain stuff. I have started learning to build smart contracts using solidity. I am building my first blockchain project currenty and I aspire to become a blockchain developer someday.
