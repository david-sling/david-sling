## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David.
#### I build websites!

## See my portfolio [here](https://davidsling.in)

- I am a full stack web developer looking for internships.
- My MERN + React Native + socket.io project: [pebble](https://github.com/david-sling/pebble)
  - It is a messaging application built for mobile and web.
- I'm currently working on: [flame-bond](https://github.com/david-sling/flame-bond)
  - This project focusses on creating an admin UI to connect React with Firebase.
- My future personal project plans:
    - Use the [flame-bond](https://github.com/david-sling/flame-bond) repository along with a new React UI to build a personal blog.
    - Make an express server to access firebase content so that when used along with [flame-bond](https://github.com/david-sling/flame-bond) a frontend developer without having knowledge of backend or firebase can setup a fullstack application.
    - Fork [flame-bond](https://github.com/david-sling/flame-bond) and the express project to create a service where multiple people can create accounts, store, retrieve and manipulate data from their frontend project, ultimately making it a hosted and easy to manage backend that can be accessed directly from the frontend.
